                An unlikely pair, Rabbit and Fox are a couple from Detroit, Michigan who like to game and enjoy the nerdy side of life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Originating from the dark wasteland of Cleveland, OH, Rabbit is the one responsible for everything here, including coding and questionable design when he isn't daylighting as a Software Developer.
                His passion for code and games runs deep, merging together to create this website for the sole purpose of helping his wife more quickly plan the parties demise. When he isn't dying to traps and natural 1's, he pretends to be a level 110 Mistweaver Monk.
                His other loves include long luxurious bubble baths, steak that is still mooing, and killing things and takeing their stuff.

                Foxy is the Director of Tiny Human Activities and a pretty amazing tank.
                She is responsible for the inspiration and (far better) design behind the projects on the site, as well as store items in the future.
                She is also accidentally quality control, due to an innate tendency to drop and/or break things.
                She likes wine and doing arts and crafts (but, mostly wine) combined with an insatiable bloodlust for aggro'ing entire rooms full of enemies.
