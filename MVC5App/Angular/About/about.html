               An unlikely pair, Rabbit and Fox are a couple of from Detroit, Michigan who like to game and enjoy the nerdier side of life.

                Originating from the dark wasteland of Cleveland, OH, Rabbit is the one responsible for all you see here, including coding and questionable UI/UX design.
                Daylighting as a Software Developer, his passion for code and games reveals itself at night, resulting in this website when he isn't pretending to be a level 110 Mistweaver Monk.
                His other loves include long luxurious bubble baths, steak that is still mooing, and killing things to take their stuff.

                Foxy is the Director of Tiny Human Activities and a pretty amazing tank.
                She is responsible for the inspiration and (far better) design behind the projects on the site.
                She is also accidentally quality control, due to an innate tendency to drop and/or break things. 
                She likes wine and doing arts and craft things (mostly wine), combined with an insatiable bloodlust for aggro'ing entire rooms full of enemies.
