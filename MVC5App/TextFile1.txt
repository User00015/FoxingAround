TODO:

I am going to make an encounter builder for 5e. Lets figure out what we need.

An encounter in 5e is two tables and the following rules:

1) Make note of XP values for each Character via a lookup table. We'll assume everyone is equal level for now.
2) Pick creatures that sum up but do not exceed this XP value.
3) Apply a modifier to monster encounters as number of monsters increases.

	Ranges are: 
	n      == %'ge modifier
	1      ==   1
	2      == 1.5
	3-6    ==   2
	7-10   == 2.5
	11-14  ==   3
	15+    ==   4

4) Match this value to the appropriate lookup table for difficulty. Difficulties are Easy/Medium/Hard/Deadly

	e.g.  Level 1 is: 25/50/75/100 per character

	An example ripped from the PDF:

		You’ve designed an encounter for four player characters and
	want to estimate how difficult it’s going to be. Three of the
	four players have 3rd-level characters and one has a character
	at 2nd level (due to missing a session).
	First, note the XP values that define the four categories
	of difficulty. For each difficulty category on the Encounter
	Difficulty XP per Character table, you’ll find the number for
	a 3rd-level character and multiply it by three (for the three
	3rd-level characters), then add the number for a 2nd-level
	character. That gives you the following numbers:
	• Easy: up to 275 XP
	• Medium: up to 550 XP
	• Hard: up to 925 XP
	• Deadly: up to 1,400 XP
	Now you look at the encounter you’ve designed, a fight
	with four hobgoblins. Each hobgoblin has an XP value of
	100, so the total XP is 400. Since there are four hobgoblins,
	you double the XP value of the encounter; the encounter’s
	XP value, for the purposes of figuring out its difficulty, is
	800 XP. That makes this encounter tougher than a medium
	encounter, but not higher than the hard threshold—so it’s a
	hard encounter.
	If you build a later encounter with four bugbears, with
	an XP value of 200 XP each, you’d end up with a total value
	of 1,600 XP for the encounter. That number is above the
	threshold of deadly encounters, meaning it’s probably too
	hard for your characters to handle. If you adjust it down to
	three bugbears, your total is 1,200 XP—still deadly, but at
	least the adventurers have a fighting chance. Two bugbears
	is probably a better encounter for this party: you multiply the
	base XP value of 400 by only 1.5 for a pair of monsters, giving
	you 600 XP—slightly easier than the hobgoblin fight
